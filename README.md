# Java/Maven Initial Solution Example

This project shows a basic example with some of the most common annotations.

This project uses Java and Maven.

We have to declare the maven-surefire-plugin in the pom.xml file and configure the dependencies of this plugin. 

We have to declare the following dependencies:

The junit-platform-surefire-provider dependency allows us to run tests that use either the “old” JUnit (3 or 4) or JUnit 5.

If we want to run tests that use either JUnit 3 or 4, we have to declare the junit-vintage-engine dependency.

If we want to run tests that use JUnit 5, we have to declare the junit-jupiter-engine dependency.

## Maven goals
### Run the unit tests
```
mvn clean test
```

### Generate javadoc for the source code
```
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

### Generate javadoc for the test code
```
mvn javadoc:test-javadoc
```

### Generate Jacoco source code coverage report
```
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Check if thresholds limits are achieved
```
mvn test jacoco:check
```

### Generates a PIT Mutation coverage report to target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI
```
mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```

### Generates a quicker PIT Mutation coverage report to target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI
```
mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DwithHistory
```

### Complete example

``` 
mvn test jacoco:report org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DwithHistory -Dsonar.pitest.mode=reuseReport -Dthreads=4 -DtimestampedReports=false
```
## Jacoco dependencies
* https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin
  - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin
    - required to work with JUnit5
